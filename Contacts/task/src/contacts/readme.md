Contacts App

- Stage1: In the first stage, you should write a program that creates an instance of a class that stores information about one record in the Contacts. One record should contain a name, a surname, and a phone number. You can type them from the keyboard.
- Stage 2: In this stage, you should write a program that keeps all the records in a list. You should be able to add, remove, edit the records, and get the number of records. If the user inputs an incorrect phone number, you should reset it as empty. If the number is empty, you should write the string [no number] instead of it.
- Stage 3: In this stage, you will write a program that can store not only information about people but also organizations.
